# Random-Gamer-Tag-Generator
Generates a random gamer tag 

This was a bit confusing to make lol.

I have 6 arrays divided into 2 catagories -- Adjectives and Nouns
Each array stores 5 strings, just some random words.

- Basically the code takes a random string from one of the 3 adjective arrays 
( It selects an array randomly ) and then also takes a random string from one of
the 3 noun arrays ( It also selects a noun array randomly )

Then the two random strings from the random arrays are concatenated to form a unique
gamer tag stored in a variable which is then logged onto the console. 225 different combinations can be made with the
available strings
